#### *[Ph.D. Student](https://classics.indiana.edu/about/graduate-students/smitten-alec.html), [Department of Classical Studies](https://classics.indiana.edu/), Indiana University - Bloomington* 

I work primarily to answer the question, "How did ancient speakers think about their own languages?" As a result, my research focuses heavily on the translation and interpretation of ancient grammatical manuals, such as Apollonius Dyscolus' *On Syntax*, and Herennius Philo's [*On the Differing Meanings of Words*](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8078/). Alongside my personal research, since 2019, I have been a member of the Utah State University [Latin Lab](https://chass.usu.edu/classics/opportunities/latin-lab/), a team of faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students who work to translate untranslated Latin texts from a variety of disciplines. 

In addition to my work in the field of Classics, I have been contributing to the documentation of both the [DigitalArc](https://digitalarcplatform.github.io/about/) project (for which I now work as one of the Project Managers), and the documentation for [Net.Create](https://netcreate.org/netcreate-userdocs).
